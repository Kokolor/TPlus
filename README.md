# T+ Language
T+ is a high-level language designed for OS development, bridging the gap between C and Assembly. With T+ you can write more human-readable code that gets compiled down to assembly, making OS development more accessible and maintainable.

## Features
- High-level constructs while staying close to the metal.
- Direct compilation to Assembly.
- Simplified syntax for common Assembly operations.
- Integration with NASM for binary output.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kokolor/TPlus.git
cd TPlus
make install
```
Note : If you are not using the 'root' account, you must add sudo before 'make install'.
